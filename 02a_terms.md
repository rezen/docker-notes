# Terms
Often the word "container" ends up acting as an umbrella containing many meanings. Two people will use the term and actually mean different components which can contribute to confusion in conversions. It is important to draw clear lines between the different possible terms around container technology. This is an (possibly inaccurate) attempt to define some terms around the components.


| Definition          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Container           | This is the actual running container. A container may have state or files that change over time that can differ significantly from the Image or ContainerDefinition. The running container has actual processes and state.                                                                                                     |
| ContainerDefinition | A ContainerDefinition is a definition how/where a container Image should be run. This includes mounts, networking, environment vars, setup & teardown commands, cluster etc. Linux capabilities are generally specified in this as well. In the context of k8s these are usually Pod definitions or with ECS Task Definitions. |
| ContainerRuntime    | This is the engine/platform containers actually run in. The runtime create/destroys containers with their configurations.  Different runtimes can have different defaults & security controls.                                                                                                                                 |
| Image               | The image is the package, the artifact that is created from an ImageDefinition. The actual Image based on an ImageDefinition can change based on when the Image was built. The image contains actual files that can be parsed and analyzed.                                                                                    |
| ImageDefinition     | An ImageDefinition is typically a Dockerfile which specifies the definition/recipe of what goes into a container image. The container definition will give you an idea of what packages, files, env vars are part of the image.                                                                                                |
